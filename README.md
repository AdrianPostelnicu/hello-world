Just my first repository on GitHub

Hello everybody!
I am learning how to use GitHub!

Adi

Adi

ok, now i created the branch first; i had forgotten it the first time...
i will make these changes and commit to the branch and then make a pull request and then merge in the master.

Wish (not wich) me luck ;).
